		<h1>SpriteSheet</h1>
		<h2>A way of importing a spritesheet and sectioning it into groups that can be animated.</h2>
		<h3>Technical Details</h3>
		<p>Takes a spritesheet, height and width of each frame, and then each range of frames (index starts at 0).</p>
		<p>Ranges are taken as 2 element arrays storing numbers, with a true or false at the end depending on if the images are mirrored or not.</p>
		<p>Individual frames are stored as Box objects, while only one image itself is stored as context.drawImage() supports sectioning of images.</p>
		<p>Each animation section is stored in the index of the object like frameGroup1[0] for the first group</p>
		<p>Constructor is as follows<br>
		SpriteSheet(imageUrl, frameWidth, frameHeight, [0, 3], [0, 3, true]) false can be ommitted from ranges as undefined is falsy
